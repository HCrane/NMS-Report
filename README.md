#No Man's Sky Report Generator


##Credits

This uses a variation of Geo Sans made especially for No Man's Sky. I have no idea who to credit for this, but if you do know, I'll add it here as soon as possible. 

The Add and Delete icons are part of the [Gooogle Material Design Icon Set](https://www.google.com/design/icons/), which is an [open source project](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).
